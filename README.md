<h2>Intermediate C# Practice with Mosh</h2>

These applications in C# were all written as exercises of the concepts I learned in the Intermediate C# course on Udemy, taught by Mosh Hamedani. In this course, I learned practiced important concepts related to object oriented programming, interface design, abstract classes, and more. 

Each application has very short title at the top of the code to explain what it is. Some applications have a .txt file to explain the purpose of the application. Below is a link to the course.
